# Card SDK Language Reference

A complete catalog of every building block available to card authors in the Argentum
Engine `mtg-sdk`, with a one-line description for each. Designed to be scanned and
searched. For step-by-step authoring workflow see [`api-guide.md`](api-guide.md) and
[`adding-new-cards-workflow.md`](adding-new-cards-workflow.md); for hard cases see
[`managing-complex-and-rare-abilities.md`](managing-complex-and-rare-abilities.md).

**Maintenance rule:** this document is the canonical SDK catalog. **Every change to the
SDK — new effect, trigger, condition, filter, cost, keyword, dynamic amount, modal
shape, replacement effect, etc. — must update the matching section here in the same
change.** If the entry doesn't fit cleanly in an existing section, add or rename a
section; do not let SDK additions land without a corresponding doc update.

## 1. Top-level card DSL

**Entry points**

- `card("Name") { ... }` — open the builder for a standard card.
- `basicLand("Plains" | "Island" | "Swamp" | "Mountain" | "Forest")` — shortcut for basic lands (sets type line,
  intrinsic mana ability, supertype).

**Card builder properties**

- `manaCost: String` — mana cost in `{X}{R}{U}` syntax.
- `typeLine: String` — full type line including supertypes and subtypes.
- `oracleText: String` — rules text; auto-generated from abilities if omitted.
- `power: Int?`, `toughness: Int?` — base P/T for creatures.
- `dynamicPower`, `dynamicToughness` — characteristic-defining P/T (e.g. `*/*` Tarmogoyf).
- `dynamicStats(source, powerOffset?, toughnessOffset?)` — sets both with optional `±` deltas.
- `startingLoyalty: Int?` — starting loyalty for planeswalkers.
- `colorIdentity: String?` — override (normally auto-detected). Treated as authoritative in this repo.
- `auraTarget: TargetRequirement?` — what this Aura enchants.
- `morph: String?` — morph mana cost (cast face-down).
- `morphCost: PayCost?` — non-mana morph cost.
- `morphFaceUpEffect: Effect?` — effect that fires when this morph turns face up.
- `warp: String?` — Warp alt-cost; exiles at end of turn.
- `evoke: String?` — Evoke alt-cost; sacrifices on ETB.
- `selfAlternativeCost: SelfAlternativeCost?` — generic alternative-cost slot.
- `castTimeCreatureTypeChoice: CastTimeCreatureTypeSource?` — forces a creature-type choice at cast time.
- `cantBeCountered: Boolean` — spell is uncounterable.
- `conditionalFlash: Condition?` — gains flash while condition holds.
- `layout: CardLayout` — physical layout shape (see §2).

**Ability blocks inside `card { ... }`**

- `triggeredAbility { ... }` — "when/whenever/at" abilities.
- `staticAbility { ... }` — continuous effects.
- `activatedAbility { ... }` — `cost: effect` abilities.
- `loyaltyAbility(±N) { ... }` — planeswalker loyalty abilities.
- `replacementEffect { ... }` — "instead/if … would" replacement.
- `keywords(...)` / `keywordAbility(...)` / `keywordAbilities(...)` — add keyword abilities.
- `spell { ... }` — define the spell payload for instants/sorceries and Adventure faces.

---

## 2. Card faces, layouts, printings, set metadata

**`CardLayout`**

- `NORMAL` — standard single face (default).
- `SPLIT` — two or more halves on one card; combined characteristics apply off-battlefield (CR 709.4c). Used for Rooms,
  Fuse, Aftermath.
- `ADVENTURE` — primary face is a creature, `cardFaces[0]` is an instant/sorcery Adventure (CR 715). Resolving the
  Adventure exiles the card and grants permission to cast the creature from exile.

**`CardFace` (SPLIT / ADVENTURE)**

- `name` — face name.
- `manaCost` — face mana cost.
- `typeLine` — face type line.
- `script { ... }` — that face's abilities.
- `keywords` — face-local keywords.

**`metadata { ... }`**

- `rarity: Rarity` — `COMMON | UNCOMMON | RARE | MYTHIC | SPECIAL | BONUS`.
- `collectorNumber: String` — Scryfall collector number.
- `artist: String` — illustrator credit.
- `flavorText: String` — italicized flavor.
- `imageUri: String?` — art URL; auto-fetched from Scryfall if omitted.
- `scryfallId: String?` — Scryfall UUID.
- `releaseDate: String?` — `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `inBooster: Boolean` — appears in draft boosters (default `true`; `false` for Special Guests / starter exclusives).
- `oracleTextOverride: String?` — bypass auto-generated oracle text.

**Reprints** — add a `Printing` row in the new set's `Reprints.kt` and wire it into `MtgSet.printings`. Never duplicate
the `CardDefinition`.

---

## 3. Costs (`Costs.*`)

- `Costs.Free` — costs nothing (`{0}`).
- `Costs.Tap` — `{T}`; tap this permanent.
- `Costs.Untap` — `{Q}`; untap this permanent.
- `Costs.Mana("{2}{U}")` — pay the given mana cost (string or `ManaCost`).
- `Costs.PayLife(amount)` — pay N life.
- `Costs.Sacrifice(filter)` — sacrifice a permanent matching the filter (may include self).
- `Costs.SacrificeAnother(filter)` — sacrifice a *different* permanent matching the filter.
- `Costs.Composite(c1, c2, ...)` — multiple costs paid together.

**Spell-level alternatives**

- `selfAlternativeCost` — generic "cast instead for" alt-cost.
- `evoke` — pay evoke cost; creature is sacrificed at ETB.
- `morph` — cast face-down for `{3}`-ish.
- `warp` — cast from anywhere; exiled at end of turn.
- `conditionalFlash` — flash while condition holds.
- `cantBeCountered` — spell is uncounterable.

**`AdditionalCost`** — extra costs paid alongside the mana cost.

- `AdditionalCost.BlightVariable` — "as you cast, you may pay X life" (Blight X); X exposed via
  `DynamicAmount.AdditionalCostBlightAmount`.
- `AdditionalCost.PayLifePerTarget(amountPerTarget)` — "this spell costs N life more to cast for
  each target." Pair with a variable-count `TargetCreature(count = 20, optional = true)` etc.; the
  engine auto-pays `amountPerTarget × action.targets.size` at cast resolution (Phyrexian Purge).

---

## 4. Effects (`Effects.*`)

Atomic effect factories. For library/zone manipulation, prefer the pipelines in §5.

### Damage

- `DealDamage(amount, target)` — deal fixed/dynamic damage.
- `DealXDamage(target)` — deal X damage (spell's X).

- `LoseLife(amount, target)` — target loses life.
- `SetLifeTotal(amount, target)` — set target's life total to N.
- `ExchangeLifeAndPower(target)` — swap target's power with controller's life total.

- `WinGame(target, message?)` — target wins the game.
- `ForceExileMultiZone(count, target)` — exile from hand/battlefield/graveyard combined (Lich's Mastery shape).

### Cards (draw / discard)

- `DrawCards(count, target?)` — draw N (default: controller).
- `DrawUpTo(max, target)` — draw up to N (player picks 0–N).
- `Discard(count, target)` — controller-of-target chooses; mandatory.
- `EachOpponentDiscards(count)` — each opponent discards N.
- `EachPlayerReturnPermanentToHand()` — each player bounces a permanent.
- `EachPlayerDrawsForDamageDealtToSource()` — each player draws equal to damage source took this turn.
- `ReadTheRunes()` — draw N, then discard N (or sacrifice permanents).
- `ReplaceNextDraw(effect)` — replaces controller's next draw with the given effect.

### Destruction & exile

- `Destroy(target)` — destroy target (respects indestructible).
- `DestroyAll(filter, noRegenerate?, storeDestroyedAs?)` — destroy all matching; optionally save the ID list for
  follow-up.
- `DestroyAllAndAttached(filter, noRegenerate?)` — also destroys auras/equipment on the matching permanents.

- `ExileUntilLeaves(target)` — linked exile; returns when source leaves the battlefield.
- `ExileGroupAndLink(filter, storeAs?)` — exile all matching permanents into source's linked exile pile.
- `ExileFromTopRepeating(count, repeatCondition)` — keep exiling top cards while a condition holds.
- `ExileLibraryUntilManaValue(manaValue)` — exile from library until mana value ≤ N.

### Return / placement

- `ReturnToHand(target)` — bounce to hand.

- `ReturnCreaturesPutInGraveyardThisTurn(player)` — Patriarch's Bidding shape.

### Hand reveal

- `Effects.MayRevealCardFromHand(filter, otherwise?)` — atomic "you may reveal a `filter`
  card from your hand" choice. Computes eligible hand cards; if none, runs `otherwise`
  silently; otherwise prompts the controller with a `SelectCardsDecision` (min=0, max=1).
  Revealing emits a `CardsRevealedEvent` and stops; declining (or empty selection) runs
  `otherwise`. Compose with `Effects.Tap`/`Effects.Sacrifice`/etc. via `otherwise` to
  express "if you don't, X" riders — e.g. SOI shadow lands wrap this in
  `OnEnterRunEffect(...)` with `otherwise = Effects.Tap(EffectTarget.Self)` for the
  "this land enters tapped" branch.

### Library reveal & free cast

- `Effects.Cascade` — CR 702.85a (`CascadeEffect`). Exile from the top of the controller's library
  until a nonland card with mana value **strictly less than** the triggering spell's is exiled,
  offer to cast it for free, bottom-randomize every exiled card that isn't cast.
- `RevealAndMayCastFromLibraryEffect(count, maxManaValue, player?)` — Sunbird's Invocation
  shape. Reveal top `count` cards of `player`'s library, present a `SELECT_CARDS` prompt over
  the revealed nonland cards with mana value ≤ `maxManaValue` (player picks 0 or 1), free-cast
  the chosen card if any, bottom-randomize the rest. Pair with `DynamicAmounts.triggeringManaValue()`
  (= `EntityProperty(Triggering, ManaValue)`) when both bounds come from the triggering spell.

### Linked exile & play-from-exile permissions

- `ReturnLinkedExile()` — return all from source's linked exile, under controller.
- `ReturnLinkedExileUnderOwnersControl()` — return under each card's owner.
- `ReturnLinkedExileToHand()` — return all from linked exile to hand.

- `GrantMayPlayFromExile(from, restriction?)` — owner may play matching cards from exile.
- `GrantPlayWithoutPayingCost(from)` — same, without paying mana costs.
- `GrantFreeCastTargetFromExile(target)` — cast specific exiled card for free.

### Stats & keywords

- `ModifyStats(power, toughness, target?)` — `±P/±T` until end of turn (default scope).
- `GrantKeyword(keyword, target, duration)` — grant a keyword for a duration.
- `RemoveKeyword(keyword, target, duration)` — strip a keyword.

- `DistributeCountersAmongTargets(total, type?, minPerTarget?)` — divvy N counters among chosen targets.
- `Proliferate()` — add one counter of each kind already present on chosen permanents/players (CR 701.27).
- `AddCountersToCollection(name, type, count)` — add counters to cards held in a pipeline collection.

### Color & type

- `AddCardType(type, target, duration)` — add a card type (e.g. become an artifact).
- `AddSubtype(subtype, target, duration)` — add a subtype temporarily.
- `ChooseColorForTarget(target)` — target picks a color; stored in context.
- `BecomeChosenManaColor(target)` — adopt the previously chosen color.
- `ChangeColor(colors, target, duration)` — replace colors with the given set.
- `BecomeAllColors(target, duration)` — five-color until end of turn.

### Mana

- `AddMana(color, amount, restriction?)` — add N of one color.
- `AddColorlessMana(amount, restriction?)` — add colorless.
- `AddManaOfChoice(colorSet, amount?, restriction?, riders?)` — **unified primitive.** Add N mana of one color the controller picks from a resolved [ManaColorSet](#manacolorset). All "any-color from a constrained pool" cards (any color, commander identity, among permanents, lands could produce, source-chosen color) are expressed as this effect plus a different `ManaColorSet`. `riders` is a `Set<ManaSpellRider>` consumed when the mana pays for a spell (e.g. Path of Ancestry tags its mana with `ScryOnSharedTypeWithCommander`); when riders are set without a `restriction`, the engine stores the entries under `ManaRestriction.AnySpend` to preserve the rider through the pool.
- `AddAnyColorMana(amount?, restriction?)` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.AnyColor, amount)`.
- `AddManaOfChosenColor(amount?)` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.SourceChosenColor, amount)`.
- `AddManaOfColorAmong(filter)` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.AmongPermanents(filter))`.

- `AddManaOfColorInCommanderColorIdentity()` — sugar for `AddManaOfChoice(ManaColorSet.CommanderIdentity)`. Arcane Signet / Command Tower shape.
- `AddAnyColorManaSpendOnChosenType(typeName)` — mana that can only pay for a specific card type (kept separate because it derives a runtime [ManaRestriction] from the source's chosen subtype).
- `AddDynamicMana(amount, allowedColors, restriction?)` — split X across a fixed color set, distinct from `AddManaOfChoice` because it distributes the full X total across multiple colors rather than producing X copies of one chosen color.
- `AddManaInAnyCombination(colors, amount)` — split N across colors (alias for `AddDynamicMana`).
- `AddOneManaOfEachColorAmong(filter)` — one mana of *each* color found among matching permanents (Bloom Tender shape).

### Tokens & emblems

- `CreateToken(name, p, t, colors?, subtypes?, keywords?, count?, tapped?)` — make N tokens.
- `CreateDynamicToken(...)` — tokens whose P/T is computed.

- `GrantSpellsCantBeCountered(target, filter, duration)` — target's matching spells become uncounterable (Domri shape).

### Control & combat

- `GainControlEffect(target, duration)` — gain control until end of turn (default).
- `ExchangeControlEffect(target1, target2)` — swap control of two permanents.
- `GainControlByMostOfSubtypeEffect(subtype)` — whoever controls the most of a tribe takes it.
- `GiftGivenEffect(target)` — "gift" temporary control.
- `CantAttackEffect(target, unless?)` — target can't attack.
- `CantBlockEffect(target, unless?)` — target can't block.
- `CantAttackGroupEffect(filter, condition?)` — group-scoped can't-attack.
- `CantBlockGroupEffect(filter, condition?)` — group-scoped can't-block.
- `Effects.Suspect(target)` — target becomes Suspected (MKM keyword). Composite: `SetSuspectedEffect` (named status, CR 701.60d dedup) + `GrantKeywordEffect(MENACE)` + `CantBlockEffect`.
- `RemoveFromCombatEffect(target)` — yank target out of combat.
- `SkipNextTurnEffect(target)` — target skips their next turn.

### Forced sacrifice / discard

- `SacrificeTargetEffect(target)` — target sacrifices itself.
- `ForceSacrificeEffect(target, count)` — edict; target sacrifices N creatures.
- `ForceReturnOwnPermanentEffect(target)` — target bounces one of their own.

### Stack manipulation

- `CounterEffect(target, condition?, destination?)` — counter a spell/ability; optionally send elsewhere.
  - `target = CounterTarget.Spell` / `Ability` / `SpellOrAbility` — `SpellOrAbility` dispatches at resolution by inspecting whether the stack entity has a `SpellOnStackComponent`. Used by Teferi's Response.
  - `condition = CounterCondition.UnlessPaysMana(cost, onPaid?)` / `UnlessPaysDynamic(amount, onPaid?)` — "unless its controller pays …" with an optional `onPaid: Effect` rider that fires **only** when the spell's controller pays (Divert Disaster's "If they do, you create a Lander token"). The rider executes with the counter's controller as `controllerId`, so "you" in the rider resolves to the caster of the counter. The rider does not fire when the spell is countered. Facade: `Effects.CounterUnlessPays(cost, onPaid)` / `Effects.CounterUnlessDynamicPays(amount, exileOnCounter, onPaid)`.
- `CounterAllOnStackEffect(filter?, destination?)` — counter everything matching.
- `DestroySourceOfTargetedAbilityEffect` — when the targeted stack object is a permanent's activated/triggered ability, destroy that source permanent. Compose *before* the counter step so the ability component is still readable (Teferi's Response).
- `CopyTargetSpellEffect(target)` — copy a spell on the stack.
- `CopyTargetTriggeredAbilityEffect(target)` — copy a triggered ability on the stack.
- `CopyNextSpellCastEffect` — copy the next spell its controller casts.

- `ChangeTargetEffect(spell, newTarget)` — change a spell's target.
- `ChangeSpellTargetEffect(spell, filter)` — same, filtered.
- `ReselectTargetRandomlyEffect(spell)` — re-choose targets at random.
- `ReturnSpellToOwnersHandEffect(spell)` — return a spell from the stack to hand.

### Combat-shape & misc

- `PreventDamageEffect(amount, direction, scope, source?, recipient?)` — prevention shield.
- `BecomeCreatureEffect(target, p, t, subtypes, keywords, duration)` — animate non-creature (lands, artifacts).
- `EachPermanentBecomesCopyOfTargetEffect(filter, target)` — Cytoshape-style mass copy.
- `AnimateLandEffect(target, subtypes, keywords, duration)` — land becomes a creature.
- `ExploreEffect(target)` — Explore mechanic (reveal top; land → battlefield, else hand + counter).
- `AttachEquipmentEffect(equip, target)` — attach an Equipment.
- `TapUntapEffect(target, isTap)` — tap or untap. Facade: `Effects.Tap` / `Effects.Untap`.
- `PhaseOutEffect(target = Self)` — phase the target permanent out (Rule 702.26); facade `Effects.PhaseOut(target)`. While phased out it's treated as though it doesn't exist (excluded from `getBattlefield`, so from projection, triggers, combat, targeting, and SBAs) and phases back in before its controller's next untap step. Indirect phasing (attached Auras/Equipment) is handled automatically. Used as the `suffer` branch of a pay-or-phase trigger (Vaporous Djinn: "phases out unless you pay {U}{U}" = `PayOrSufferEffect(PayCost.Mana(...), Effects.PhaseOut())`).
- `MarkExileOnDeathEffect(target)` — replace next "to graveyard" with "to exile".
- `OptionalCostEffect(cost, effect)` — pay cost to trigger an effect.
- `StoreResultEffect(effect, as)` — stash an effect's result for later reference.
- `StoreCountEffect(effect, as)` — stash a count for later reference.
- `RepeatWhileEffect(condition, effect, maxIterations?)` — run effect repeatedly while condition holds.

### Sequencing & conditional

- `CompositeEffect(effects)` / `Composite(e1, e2, ...)` — run effects in order.
- `ConditionalEffect(condition, ifTrue, ifFalse?)` / `Branch(...)` — conditional branch.
- `IfYouDoEffect(action, reflexive, optional)` — if optional action is taken, run reflexive effect.
- `ReflexiveTriggerEffect(action, reflexive, optional)` — same shape but the reflexive effect goes on the stack.

### Modal & choice

- `ModalEffect.chooseOne { mode(...) }` / `ModalEffect.chooseN(n) { ... }` — modal effect block.
- `ChooseActionEffect(choices)` — player picks from a list of effects.
- `ChooseColorAndGrantProtectionToTargetEffect(target)` — pick a color, grant protection to target.
- `ChooseColorAndGrantProtectionToGroupEffect(filter)` — same, for a group.
- `ChooseColorThenEffect(whenChosen)` — pick a color, then run a function of that color.
- `GrantHexproofFromChosenColorEffect(target)` — hexproof from chosen color.
- `ChooseCreatureTypeEffect(...)` — pause for creature-type pick.
- `SelectTargetEffect(...)` — have a player pick from a valid set.
- `SeparatePermanentsIntoPilesEffect(filter, piles)` — divvy into piles (Fact-or-Fiction shape).

> **Authoring rule:** prefer composing primitives over adding parameters to an existing effect. Use `CompositeEffect`
> and the gather/select/move pipeline before writing a new executor.

- `EffectTarget.ContextProperty(key)` — value plumbed into `EffectContext` (damage amount, life gained, blight
  amount, …).
- `EnchantedCreature` / `EquippedCreature` — resolve via `AttachedToComponent`; requires the state-aware
  `resolveTarget(state, target)` overload.
- `EnchantedPermanent` — same `AttachedToComponent` resolution as `EnchantedCreature`, but type-agnostic; use for
  Auras that enchant non-creature permanents (e.g. Wellspring enchants a land: "gain control of enchanted land").

### Cast-time (`Targets.*` / `TargetRequirement`)

- `Targets.Any` — any creature, player, or planeswalker.
- `Targets.AnyOtherThanEnchantedCreature` — any target except the creature the source Aura/Equipment
  is attached to. Desugars to `TargetOther(AnyTarget(), excludeAttachedCreature = true)`; for Aura/Equipment
  abilities worded "enchanted/equipped creature deals damage … to **any other target**" (e.g. Pain for All),
  where the dealer is the attached creature, not the ability's source permanent.
- `Targets.Creature` — any creature.
- `Targets.Player` — any player.
- `Targets.Planeswalker` — any planeswalker.
- `Targets.Permanent` — any permanent.
- `Targets.NonlandPermanent` — any nonland permanent.
- `Targets.Artifact` — any artifact.
- `Targets.Enchantment` — any enchantment.
- `Targets.Land` — any land.
- `Targets.BasicLand` — any basic land.
- `Targets.Spell` — any spell on the stack.
- `Targets.Card` — any card in any zone (e.g. graveyard).
- `Targets.CreatureOrPlaneswalker` — combined.
- `Targets.TappedCreature` / `UntappedCreature` — state-restricted.
- `Targets.InstantOrSorcery` — instant-or-sorcery card.

**Chained predicates** — `.youControl()`, `.controlledByOpponent()`, `.opponent()`, `.withSubtype(...)`,
`.withKeyword(...)`, `.ofColor(...)`, `.tapped()`, `.untapped()`, `.power(n)`, `.minPower(n)`, `.maxPower(n)`; plus
`TargetFilter.excludeSelf` to exclude the source.

### Named multi-target binding

```kotlin
spell {
    val creature = target("creature", Targets.Creature)
    val player = target("player", Targets.Player)
    effect = Effects.Composite(
        Effects.Destroy(creature),
        Effects.DealDamage(3, player),
    )
}
```

For modal spells, prefer the explicit `targetPlayerControls(target)` DSL form; per-mode targets route via
`modeTargetsOrdered`.

## 7. Filters & predicates

### `GameObjectFilter` — for searches, sacrifice, group effects

- `Filters.AnyCard` — any card.
- `Filters.Creature` — any creature card.
- `Filters.Land` — any land card.
- `Filters.BasicLand` — any basic land.
- `Filters.PlainsCard` / `IslandCard` / `SwampCard` / `MountainCard` / `ForestCard` — specific basics.
- `Filters.Instant` — instant card.
- `Filters.Sorcery` — sorcery card.
- `Filters.Permanent` — permanent card.
- `Filters.NonlandPermanent` — nonland permanent.
- `Filters.WithSubtype(subtype)` — card of a given subtype.

**Chained predicates**

- `.youControl()` / `.controlledByOpponent()` — control predicate.
- `.withSubtype(s)` / `.withKeyword(k)` — type/ability predicate.
- `.ofColor(c)` / `.ofColors(set)` — color predicate.
- `.power(n)` / `.minPower(n)` / `.maxPower(n)` — P/T comparator.
- `.tapped()` / `.untapped()` — tap state.
- `.nontoken()` / `.token()` — token vs printed.
- `.faceDown()` — face-down state.
- `.card(filter)` — defer to a card-shape filter for off-battlefield checks.

**Explicit constructor**:
`GameObjectFilter(cardPredicates, controllerPredicate, colorPredicate, keywordPredicate, powerToughnessPredicate, subtypePredicate)`.

### `GroupFilter` — static-ability scope

- `GroupFilter.CreaturesYouControl` — your creatures.
- `GroupFilter.CreaturesOpponentControls` — their creatures.
- `GroupFilter.AllCreatures` — every creature on the battlefield.
- `GroupFilter.All(filter)` — custom group.
- Chained: `.withColor`, `.withoutColor`, `.withKeyword`, `.withoutKeyword`, `.withSubtype`, `.withoutSubtype`,
  `.minPower`, `.maxPower`, `.power`.

### Stack-object predicates

These `CardPredicate`s evaluate against entities in the `Zone.STACK` (spells and activated/triggered
abilities on the stack). They are handled in the evaluator before the `CardComponent` check, so they
work for abilities-on-stack (which carry no `CardComponent`).

- `CardPredicate.IsActivatedOrTriggeredAbility` — true for activated/triggered abilities on the stack
  (Stifle).
- `CardPredicate.IsTriggeredAbility` — triggered abilities only (excludes activated abilities and
  spells).
- `CardPredicate.TargetsMatching(subfilter)` — true when the stack object's `TargetsComponent`
  includes at least one chosen target matching `subfilter`. Player targets are skipped. The
  subfilter inherits the outer `PredicateContext`, so `Land.youControl()` inside the subfilter
  resolves against the outer chooser. Used by Teferi's Response.

### `StatePredicate` — battlefield state checks

- `IsTapped` — currently tapped.
- `IsUntapped` — currently untapped.
- `IsAttacking` — declared as attacker this combat.
- `IsBlocking` — declared as blocker this combat.
- `IsFaceDown` — currently face-down.
- `HasCounter(type)` — has at least one counter of `type`.
- `IsWarpExiled` (filter builder `warpExiled()`) — card in exile via warp's
  end-of-turn delayed trigger (CR 702.185b).
- `WasCastForWarp` (filter builder `castForWarp()`) — battlefield permanent that
  was cast for its warp cost (CR 702.185). Pair with
  `Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter(GameObjectFilter.Creature.castForWarp(), …)` to
  branch on whether a target was warp-cast (e.g., Full Bore).

### `AffectsFilter` — static-ability target shapes

- `OtherCreaturesWithSubtype` — lord scope (other creatures of subtype).
- `CreaturesWithCounter` — creatures with at least one counter (Aurification).

> **Load-bearing rule:** filtering battlefield permanents by type/subtype/color/keyword/P-T MUST use
`predicateEvaluator.matchesWithProjection(state, projected, ...)`. Use `projected.isCreature(entityId)` rather than
`cardComponent.typeLine.isCreature`. Non-battlefield zones may read base state.

---

## 8. Triggered abilities (`Triggers.*`)

`triggeredAbility { trigger; effect; target?; triggerCondition?; optional?; checkOnNextState?; dealsDamageBeforeResolve?; controlledByTriggeringEntityController? }`.

### Zone change

Named sugar for the common cases; reach for `entersBattlefield(...)` / `leavesBattlefield(...)`
for any other (filter, binding, to/excludeTo) combination.

**Enters the battlefield**

- `EntersBattlefield` — SELF, no filter. ("When this permanent enters.")
- `OtherCreatureEnters` — OTHER binding, filter = `Creature.youControl()`.
- `LandYouControlEnters` — landfall: OTHER binding, filter = `Land.youControl()`.
- `entersBattlefield(filter, binding)` — factory. Covers face-down filters,
  ANY-binding tribal scopes, permanent-you-control scopes, enchantment-enters scopes (Eerie), etc.

**Leaves / dies**

- `LeavesBattlefield` — SELF, any destination.
- `Dies` — SELF, battlefield → graveyard.
- `AnyCreatureDies` — ANY binding, filter = `Creature`.
- `YourCreatureDies` — ANY binding, filter = `Creature.youControl()`.
- `PutIntoGraveyardFromBattlefield` — SELF, same event shape as `Dies`; rename
  clarifies non-creature intent (artifact / enchantment going to yard).
- `leavesBattlefield(filter, to?, excludeTo?, binding)` — factory. `to = GRAVEYARD`
  gives a "dies" variant scoped beyond the named constants (other tribal deaths,
  any-controller deaths); `excludeTo = GRAVEYARD` gives "leaves without dying"
  (Three Tree Scribe shape); leaving both null gives "leaves to any zone."

### Combat

Named sugar for the common cases; reach for `attacks(...)` / `blocks(...)` /
`becomesBlocked(...)` for any other combination, and use the [AttackPredicate]
sealed set for attack-time facts beyond the basics.

**Attacks (per-attacker `AttackEvent`)**

- `Attacks` — SELF, no filter. ("When this creature attacks.")
- `attacks(filter?, requires?, binding?)` — factory. Covers ANY-binding scopes,
  type-filtered scopes (creature-you-control, nontoken-creature-you-control),
  and attack-time predicates (alone, future Battalion-style count gates).

**Attacks (player-level)**

- `YouAttack` — when you declare attackers (player-level, ANY binding).
- `YouAttackWithFilter(filter)` — when you attack with ≥1 matching attacker.
- `CreaturesAttackYou` — defender side; fires once per `AttackersDeclaredEvent`,
  not per attacker. Excludes creatures attacking a planeswalker you control
  (CR 509.1b). Pair with `DynamicAmounts.creaturesAttackingYou()` for
  attacker-count payoffs (e.g., Orim's Prayer).

**Blocks**

- `Blocks` — SELF, no filter.
- `BecomesBlocked` — SELF, no filter.
- `blocks(filter?, binding?, attackerFilter?)` — factory. `filter` constrains the
  blocker (ANY binding). `attackerFilter` constrains the blocked attacker — requires
  SELF binding for "whenever this creature blocks a [filter]" (Skystinger);
  combining it with ANY is rejected (the ANY detector branch ignores `attackerFilter`).
  `triggeringEntityId` is set to the blocked attacker in that case.
- `becomesBlocked(filter?, binding?)` — factory. Replaces the old
  `CreatureYouControlBecomesBlocked` and `FilteredBecomesBlocked(filter)`.
- `BlocksOrBecomesBlockedBy(filter)` — either direction, partner-filtered;
  sole consumer of `BlocksOrBecomesBlockedByEvent`. Prefer `blocks(attackerFilter=...)`
  when only the blocking direction should fire.

**`AttackPredicate`** — extensible "facts about an attack declaration."
Adding a new attack-time mechanic is one new sealed-case + one matcher branch
— `AttackEvent` does not grow a new field per axis.

- `AttackPredicate.Alone` — the attacker is the only declared attacker this
  combat (`attacker count == 1`). Replaces the old `alone: Boolean` axis.
- `AttackPredicate.AttackerCountAtLeast(n)` — at least N creatures total were
  declared as attackers (counting the trigger's attacker). Battalion shape:
  `attacks(requires = setOf(AttackerCountAtLeast(3)))` on a `SELF` binding.

Examples:

```kotlin
// "Whenever this creature attacks alone"
Triggers.attacks(requires = setOf(AttackPredicate.Alone))

// "Whenever a nontoken creature you control attacks"
Triggers.attacks(
    filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl().nontoken(),
    binding = TriggerBinding.ANY,
)

// "Whenever a Beast becomes blocked"
Triggers.becomesBlocked(
    filter = GameObjectFilter.Creature.withSubtype("Beast"),
    binding = TriggerBinding.ANY,
)

// "Whenever this creature blocks a creature with flying" (Skystinger)
Triggers.blocks(attackerFilter = GameObjectFilter.Creature.withKeyword(Keyword.FLYING))
```

### Damage

Named sugar for the common cases; reach for the factories for any other combination of axes.

- `DealsDamage` — source deals any damage (SELF binding).
- `DealsCombatDamageToPlayer` — source deals combat damage to a player (SELF binding).
- `DealsCombatDamageToCreature` — source deals combat damage to a creature (SELF binding).
- `TakesDamage` — source is dealt damage by any source (SELF binding).
- `CreatureDealtDamageByThisDies` — Etali / Sengir / Soul Collector shape; only consumer of `CreatureDealtDamageBySourceDiesEvent`.

**Factories** (axes: `damageType` × `recipient` × `sourceFilter` × `binding` for outgoing; `source` × `binding` for incoming):

- `dealsDamage(damageType?, recipient?, sourceFilter?, binding?)` — outgoing-damage trigger. Pick `DamageType.{Any,Combat,NonCombat}`, `RecipientFilter.{Any,AnyPlayer,AnyPlayerOrPlaneswalker,AnyCreature,…}`, an optional source `GameObjectFilter`, and `TriggerBinding.{SELF,ANY,ATTACHED}`. Covers "deals combat damage to a player or planeswalker", "creature you control deals combat damage to a player" (`binding = ANY` + `sourceFilter = Creature.youControl()`), "nontoken creature you control deals…" (`.nontoken()`), and "enchanted creature deals damage" (`binding = ATTACHED`).
- `takesDamage(source?, binding?)` — incoming-damage trigger. Pick `SourceFilter.{Any,Creature,Spell,Combat,NonCombat,HasColor(c),…}` and `TriggerBinding.{SELF,ATTACHED}`. Covers "damaged by a creature/spell" and "enchanted creature is dealt damage" (`binding = ATTACHED`, Aurification / Frozen Solid shape).

### Phase & turn

Named sugar for the common `(step, player)` cases; reach for `phase(step, player?, binding?)`
for anything else (the ATTACHED-binding aura shapes, custom step/player combinations).

- `YourUpkeep` — start of your upkeep.
- `YourDrawStep` — start of your draw step.
- `EachUpkeep` — every upkeep.
- `EachOpponentUpkeep` — at each opponent's upkeep.
- `YourEndStep` — beginning of your end step.
- `EachEndStep` — beginning of each end step.
- `BeginCombat` — start of combat on your turn.
- `EachCombat` — beginning of each combat (any player's turn).
- `FirstMainPhase` — start of pre-combat main.
- `YourPostcombatMain` — start of post-combat main.

**Factory** — `phase(step, player = Player.You, binding = TriggerBinding.ANY)`.

### Aura / equipment

No named constants for the "enchanted/equipped creature does X" shapes — they all collapse to
the existing event factories with `binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED`. Examples (all card uses
in the repo today):

- *Enchanted creature dies* (Demonic Vigor):
  `Triggers.leavesBattlefield(to = Zone.GRAVEYARD, binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted/equipped creature leaves the battlefield* (Curator's Ward):
  `Triggers.leavesBattlefield(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted/equipped creature attacks* (Extra Arms, Heart-Piercer Bow, Ordeal of Nylea,
  Chorale of the Void, Atomic Microsizer, Sorcerer Role token):
  `Triggers.attacks(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted permanent becomes tapped* (Uncontrolled Infestation, Cryoshatter):
  `Triggers.becomesTapped(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted creature is turned face up* (Fatal Mutation):
  `Triggers.turnedFaceUp(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *At the beginning of enchanted creature's controller's `<step>`* (Custody Battle,
  Lingering Death): `Triggers.phase(step, binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`
- *Enchanted-creature damage triggers* — damage factories already support binding:
  `Triggers.dealsDamage(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)` (any damage),
  `Triggers.dealsDamage(damageType = Combat, recipient = AnyPlayer, binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)`,
  `Triggers.takesDamage(binding = TriggerBinding.ATTACHED)` (Aurification / Frozen Solid).

### Cards & draws

- `YouDraw` — when you draw a card.
- `RevealCreatureFromDraw` — Hatching Plans-style top-card reveal.
- `RevealCardFromDraw` — generic reveal-from-draw trigger.
- `CardsPutIntoYourGraveyard(filter?)` — when matching cards enter your yard.
- `PermanentCardsPutIntoYourGraveyard` — only permanent cards.
- `CreaturesPutIntoGraveyardFromLibrary` — mill-trigger shape.

### Discard

Fires once per card discarded — a single resolution that discards N cards fires the
trigger N times (mirrors how `YouDraw` handles multi-card draws). The engine emits
one aggregate `CardsDiscardedEvent` per resolution and fans it out in the detector.
`Player.TriggeringPlayer` resolves to the discarding player inside the effect.

- `AnyOpponentDiscards` — whenever an opponent discards a card. (Entropic Battlecruiser.)
- `YouDiscard` — whenever you discard a card.

**Factory** — `discards(player?, cardFilter?)` — generic shape. `player = Player.Each`
matches any player; `cardFilter` narrows the fan-out to matching cards, so a batch that
discards a creature and two lands fires a `cardFilter = Creature` trigger once, not three
times. The cardFilter is evaluated against the **post-discard zone** (the cards are already
in the graveyard when the trigger matches) — safe for type/subtype/color predicates,
but a filter that depends on hand-specific state would read the wrong zone.

### Spell casting

Named sugar for the common type-primitive cases; reach for `youCastSpell(...)` plus a
`SpellCastPredicate` set for anything from-zone / kicked / mana-source-tagged.

- `YouCastSpell` — any spell you cast.
- `YouCastCreature` — any creature spell you cast.
- `YouCastNoncreature` — non-creature spells you cast.
- `YouCastInstantOrSorcery` — instant/sorcery you cast.
- `YouCastEnchantment` — any enchantment you cast.
- `YouCastHistoric` — artifact / legendary / Saga.
- `YouCastSubtype(subtype)` — tribal helper: spell with matching subtype.
- `AnySpellOrAbilityOnStack` — any object hits the stack.

**Factory** — `youCastSpell(spellFilter?, requires: Set<SpellCastPredicate>)`. The
`requires` set is conjunctive — every predicate must hold for the trigger to fire.

**`SpellCastPredicate`** — extensible "facts about a cast." Adding a new cast-time mechanic
(was-copied, was-overloaded, paid-additional-life-cost, …) is one new sealed-case plus one
matcher branch — `SpellCastEvent` does not grow a new field per axis.

- `SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZone(zone)` — spell was cast from this zone. Used for Sunbird's
  Invocation (`Zone.HAND`), Goliath Daydreamer's instant/sorcery-from-hand trigger,
  Wildsear's enchantment-from-hand cascade.
- `SpellCastPredicate.WasKicked` — spell was cast with kicker (CR 702.32). Used for
  Hallar / Bloodstone Goblin.
- `SpellCastPredicate.PaidWithManaFromSubtype(subtype)` — mana from a permanent of this
  subtype was spent on the cast. Resolves Treasure today (Rain of Riches, Alchemist's
  Talent); engine matcher accepts other token subtypes as the shape, but only Treasure
  actually fires until the mana-pool tracker generalizes beyond its current Treasure-only
  boolean.
- `SpellCastPredicate.IsModal` — spell was cast with at least one chosen mode (rules
  700.2). Matches `SpellCastEvent.chosenModesCount > 0`, where the count is the size of
  `SpellOnStackComponent.chosenModes` (so Spree picking the same mode twice counts as
  two). Used by Riku of Many Paths: "Whenever you cast a modal spell, …".

Examples:

```kotlin
// "Whenever you cast a spell from your hand"
Triggers.youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZone(Zone.HAND)))

// "Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery from your hand"
Triggers.youCastSpell(
    spellFilter = GameObjectFilter.InstantOrSorcery,
    requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZone(Zone.HAND)),
)

// "Whenever you cast a kicked spell"
Triggers.youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.WasKicked))

// "Whenever you cast a spell using mana from a Treasure"
Triggers.youCastSpell(
    requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.PaidWithManaFromSubtype(Subtype.TREASURE)),
)

// "Whenever you cast a modal spell" (Riku of Many Paths)
Triggers.youCastSpell(requires = setOf(SpellCastPredicate.IsModal))

// "Whenever you cast a noncreature or Otter spell"
Triggers.youCastSpell(
    spellFilter = GameObjectFilter.Noncreature or
                  GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype(Subtype("Otter")),
)
```

### State change & misc

- `TurnedFaceUp` — source turns face up. Use `turnedFaceUp(binding)` for the ATTACHED-binding aura variant (Fatal Mutation).
- `CreatureTurnedFaceUp(player?)` — when a creature you control turns face up.
- `GainControlOfSelf` — you gain control of source.
- `BecomesTarget(filter?)` — source becomes target of spell/ability.
- `CreatureYouControlBecomesTargetByOpponent(filter?)` — your creature gets targeted by opponent.
- `Transforms` — source transforms (either direction).
- `TransformsToFront` — to front face.
- `TransformsToBack` — to back face.
- `YouCycleThis` — you cycle source.
- `AnyPlayerCycles` — anyone cycles.
- `YouCommitCrime` — MKM crime mechanic.
- `YouGiveAGift` — Gift mechanic.
- `Valiant` — Bloomburrow Valiant trigger.
- `RoomFullyUnlocked` — Rooms — both doors unlocked.
- `OnDoorUnlocked` — single Room door unlocked.

### Life

- `YouGainLife` — you gain any life.
- `AnyPlayerGainsLife` — anyone gains life.
- `YouLoseLife` — you lose any life.
- `AnyPlayerLosesLife` — anyone loses life.
- `YouGainOrLoseLife` — combined life-change.

### Sacrifice & counters

- `YouSacrificeOneOrMore(filter?)` — you sac ≥1 matching.
- `Sacrificed` — source is sacrificed.
- `PlusOneCountersPlacedOnYourCreature` — Hardened Scales shape.
- `OneOrMorePermanentsEnter(filter?)` — batched ETB trigger.
- `OneOrMoreLeaveWithoutDying(...)` — batched LTB-without-dying.

### Conditional

- `NthSpellCast(n, player?)` — fires on the Nth spell cast.
- `Expend(threshold)` — Expend N (CLB mechanic).

### Delayed & granted triggers

- `DelayedTriggeredAbility` — registered now, fires at a specific future step (Astral Slide).
- `Effects.GrantTriggeredAbilityEffect` — grant a triggered ability for a duration; `GrantTriggeredAbilityExecutor` uses
  projected state and supports leaves-battlefield-to-zone triggers.

---

## 9. Static abilities

```kotlin
staticAbility {
    ability = Modification.GrantKeyword(Keyword.FLYING)
    filter = GroupFilter.CreaturesYouControl.withSubtype("Soldier")
    duration = Duration.Permanent
    layer = Layer.PT_POWER_TOUGHNESS    // optional; usually inferred
    condition = Conditions.YouControl(Filters.Swamp)
}
```

**`Modification` options**

- `AddSubtype(subtype)` — add a subtype to matching creatures.
- `RemoveSubtype(subtype)` — strip a subtype.
- `ReplaceSubtypes(subtypes)` — set the subtype list outright.
- `ModifyStats(p, t)` — `±P/±T`.
- `SetPower(p)` — overwrite power.
- `SetToughness(t)` — overwrite toughness.
- `SetStats(p, t)` — overwrite both.
- `GrantKeyword(keyword)` — grant a keyword.
- `RemoveKeyword(keyword)` — remove a keyword.
- `GrantProtection(color)` — grant protection from a color.
- `Custom(...)` — escape hatch for one-off modifications.

**Composite static abilities**

- `ModifyStatsForCreatureGroup` — lord-style P/T booster targeting a group.
- `GrantKeywordByCounter` — Aurification — keyword based on counters present.
- `AddCreatureTypeByCounter` — subtype based on counters present.
- `ConditionalStaticAbility` — static gated by a runtime `Condition`.
- `Effects.CreatePermanentEmblem(...)` — emblem with static abilities (planeswalker ultimates).
- `AttackTax(amountPerAttacker: DynamicAmount)` — Propaganda / Ghostly Prison / Windborn Muse /
  Collective Restraint. Per-attacker generic-mana tax for attacking the source's controller; the
  amount is a `DynamicAmount` so it can scale with state (e.g., `DynamicAmounts.domain()` for
  "{X} where X is your domain"). Evaluated with the source permanent's controller as "you".
  When `totalTax > 0`, the engine pauses `DeclareAttackers` for a `YesNoDecision` *before* tapping
  any mana — declining is a clean no-op that leaves the player in `DECLARE_ATTACKERS` to re-declare.
  The same prompt/cancel pattern applies to block-tax floating effects (e.g. Whipgrass Entangler)
  via `AttackBlockTaxPerCreatureType`.
- `CantBeAttackedWithout(keyword)` — Form of the Dragon-style "Creatures without flying can't
  attack you." defender-side restriction.

**Global denial statics** (no `filter`/`duration` block — they're singleton-style)

- `PreventCycling` — "Players can't cycle cards." (Stabilizer)
- `PreventActivatedAbilities(filter)` — activated abilities (mana + non-mana) of matching
  permanents can't be activated; loyalty abilities and animation costs that haven't yet
  produced a creature are unaffected. (Cursed Totem → `GameObjectFilter.Creature`)
- `PreventManaPoolEmptying` — mana pools don't empty between steps/phases. (Upwelling)
- `NoMaximumHandSize` — controller has no hand-size limit. (Thought Vessel)
- `DampLandManaProduction` — a land tapped for 2+ mana produces `{C}` instead. (Damping Sphere)

> Multiple lord effects on one card → multiple `staticAbility { }` blocks.

---

## 10. Activated abilities

```kotlin
activatedAbility {
    cost = Costs.Tap
    effect = Effects.DrawCards(1)
    target = Targets.Creature
    optional = false
    timing = TimingRule.Normal
    isManaAbility = false
    restriction = ActivationRestriction.MaxPerTurn(1)
}
```

**`TimingRule`**

- `Normal` — at instant speed (default for most abilities).
- `ManaAbility` — resolves immediately, doesn't use the stack (CR 605).
- `SorcerySpeed` — only during your main phase, empty stack.
- `OnlyIfCondition(c)` — guarded by a runtime condition.

**`ActivationRestriction`**

- `MaxPerTurn(n)` — at most N activations per turn.
- `OnlyOnce` — once per game.
- `OnlyIfCondition(c)` — condition gate.

**Loyalty abilities**

- `loyaltyAbility(+N) { ... }` — add loyalty + effect.
- `loyaltyAbility(-N) { ... }` — remove loyalty + effect.
- `loyaltyAbility(0) { ... }` — 0-loyalty ability.

---

## 11. Keywords

**`Keyword` enum (display-level)**

Flying, Menace, Intimidate, Fear, Shadow, Horsemanship, all landwalks (Plainswalk … Forestwalk), First Strike, Double
Strike, Trample, Deathtouch, Lifelink, Vigilance, Reach, Provoke, Flanking, Defender, Indestructible, Hexproof, Shroud, Haste,
Flash, Prowess, Changeling, Convoke, Delve, Affinity, Storm, Flashback, Evoke, Conspire, Hideaway, Cascade, Plot, Offspring,
Persist, Ascend, Wither, Toxic, Eerie, Vivid, Fateful Bite, … (display-only — engine effect lives in handlers or
composite abilities).

**Parameterized `KeywordAbility.*`**

- `Ward(amount)` — opponent pays cost to target this.
- `Protection(color)` — protection from a single color.
- `ProtectionFrom(set)` — protection from a set of colors/types.
- `Affinity(filter)` — cost reduction per matching permanent.
- `Amplify(n)` — ETB reveal-creatures-for-counters.
- `Devour(multiplier, sacrificeFilter, variant)` — "As this enters, you may sacrifice any number of [sacrificeFilter]. It enters with [multiplier] × that many +1/+1 counters." Plain Devour uses `sacrificeFilter = Creature` and `variant = ""`; the Edge of Eternities variant "Devour land N" uses `KeywordAbility.devourLand(n)` (`sacrificeFilter = Land`, `variant = "land"`). The keyword surfaces the rules text; pair with [`EntersWithDevour`](#15-replacement-effects) for the mechanical behavior.
- `Annihilator(n)` — attacker forces sacrifices.
- `Absorb(n)` — prevent N damage each time it would be dealt to this.
- `Bushido(n)` — +N/+N when blocking or blocked.
- `Rampage(n)` — +N/+N for each blocker past the first.
- `Afflict(n)` — defender loses N when this becomes blocked.
- `Crew(n)` — tap N power worth to animate a Vehicle.
- `Modular(n)` — ETB with +1/+1 counters, transfer on death.
- `Fading(n)` — ETB with N fade counters; removes one each upkeep, sacrifice if can't.
- `Vanishing(n)` — same idea with time counters.
- `Renown(n)` — first combat damage to a player grants renown counters.
- `Fabricate(n)` — ETB choose +1/+1 counters or Servo tokens.
- `Tribute(n)` — opponent chooses ETB bonus.
- `Toxic(n)` — adds poison counters on combat damage.
- `Cycling(cost)` — pay cost, discard, draw a card.
- `BasicLandcycling(cost)` — cycling that fetches a basic land type.
- `Typecycling(type, cost)` — cycling that fetches a card type.
- `Plot(cost)` — `KeywordAbility.plot(cost)`. Special action available during your main phase while the stack is empty: pay [cost] and exile the card from your hand. It becomes plotted (stamped with a `PlottedComponent`). On a later turn you may cast it from exile without paying its mana cost, as a sorcery (CR 718). Cast permission is granted via the engine's standard `MayPlayPermission` + `PlayWithoutPayingCostComponent`, gated by `Conditions.SourcePlottedOnPriorTurn`. No card-side wiring needed — declare the keyword ability on the card and the engine handles the rest.
- `Hideaway(n)` — `KeywordAbility.hideaway(n)`; display tag rendered "Hideaway N". Mechanic is composed manually via `MoveCollectionEffect(faceDown = true, linkToSource = true)` + `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()` — the keyword itself carries no engine behavior.
- `OptionalAdditionalCost(manaCost?, additionalCost?, multi, displayPrefix, branchesEffect, grantsFlashTiming)` — generalised "pay an optional extra cost while casting" primitive. Backs printed Kicker / Multikicker / Offspring **and** the pre-kicker "pay {N} more to cast as though it had flash" pattern (Ghitu Fire). When `branchesEffect = true` (default) paying the cost marks the spell so `WasKicked` fires for the card's own effect/triggers; when `false` the payment is invisible to `WasKicked` (used by `flashKicker`). When `grantsFlashTiming = true` paying the cost unlocks instant-speed casting in addition to whatever else it does. Prefer the factories: `KeywordAbility.kicker(cost)`, `KeywordAbility.kicker(additionalCost)`, `KeywordAbility.multikicker(cost)`, `KeywordAbility.offspring(cost)`, `KeywordAbility.flashKicker(cost)`. Serial name is `Kicker` for wire compatibility.
- `Morph(cost)` — cast face-down for `{3}`, flip for cost.
- `Unmorph(cost, effect)` — turn-face-up cost + bonus effect.
- `Equip(cost)` — Equipment attach cost.
- `Fortify(cost)` — Aura-like attach cost on lands.

## 12. Conditions (`Conditions.*`)

### Battlefield state

- `YouControl(filter)` — you control ≥1 matching permanent.
- `ControlCreature` — you control any creature.
- `ControlMoreCreatures` — you control more creatures than each opponent.
- `OpponentControlsCreature` — at least one opponent has a creature.
- `OpponentControlsMoreCreatures` — an opponent outpaces you.
- `OpponentControlsMoreLands` — an opponent has more lands.
- `OpponentControlsLandType(type)` — opponent controls land of a type.
- `TargetControlsCreature(target)` — target player has a creature.
- `TargetControlsLand(target)` — target player has a land.
- `YouHaveCitysBlessing` — you have City's Blessing (10+ permanents).

### Life & damage

- `LifeAtLeast(n, player?)` — player has ≥N life.
- `LifeAtMost(n, player?)` — player has ≤N life.
- `YouLostLife` — you lost life this turn.
- `OpponentLostLife` — an opponent lost life this turn.

### Cast / cost

- `WasCast` — source was cast (not put onto the stack).
- `WasCastFromHand` — cast specifically from hand.
- `WasCastFromZone(zone)` — cast from a specific zone.
- `WasKicked` — cast with kicker / multikicker / offspring (i.e. an `OptionalAdditionalCost` with `branchesEffect = true` whose extra cost was paid). FlashKicker payments are intentionally invisible to this condition.
- `BlightWasPaid(amount)` — the Blight X additional cost was paid.

### Source state

All "source matches X" conditions desugar to `SourceMatches(filter)` — a generic predicate
check against the source entity that works in both resolution and static-ability (projection)
contexts.

- `SourceMatches(filter)` — primitive: source entity matches a `GameObjectFilter`.
- `SourceIsAttacking` — source is attacking.
- `SourceIsBlocking` — source is blocking.
- `SourceIsTapped` — source is tapped.
- `SourceIsUntapped` — source is untapped.
- `SourceEnteredThisTurn` — source entered the battlefield this turn.
- `SourceHasDealtDamage` — source has dealt damage since entering the battlefield.
- `SourceHasDealtCombatDamageToPlayer` — saboteur-style payoff gate.
- `SourceIsModified` — has counters, attached Equipment, or controller-owned Aura
  attached (CR 700.4). Kept as a dedicated condition because the controller-of-Aura
  match isn't expressible via the generic `SourceMatches` machinery.
- `SourceHasSubtype(subtype)` — `SourceMatches(GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype(...))`;
  Changeling is honored.
- `SourceHasKeyword(keyword)` — `SourceMatches(GameObjectFilter.Any.withKeyword(...))`.
- `SourceHasCounter(counterType)` — `SourceMatches(GameObjectFilter.Any` with the
  corresponding `StatePredicate.HasCounter` / `HasAnyCounter`).

### Turn / phase

- `IsYourTurn` — it's your turn.
- `IsNotYourTurn` — it's an opponent's turn.
- `IsInPhase(phase)` — currently in `BEGINNING | MAIN | COMBAT | …`.

### Per-turn counts

All three are parameterised by a `Player` reference (default `Player.You`), so they
work in both resolution and static-ability (projection) contexts. The DSL helpers
default to "you" so card authors don't need to pass it explicitly.

- `YouAttackedWithCreaturesThisTurn(filter, atLeast)` — Raid/Battalion shape. Backed by
  `PlayerAttackedWithCreaturesThisTurn(Player.You, filter, atLeast)`.
- `YouCastSpellsThisTurn(atLeast, filter)` — Prowess/Magecraft shape. Backed by
  `PlayerCastSpellsThisTurn(Player.You, filter, atLeast)`.
- `YouHaveCitysBlessing` — Ascend gate. Backed by `PlayerHasCitysBlessing(Player.You)`.
- `IsFirstSpellPaidWithTreasureManaCastThisTurn` — gates a triggered ability to fire only
  on the first spell each turn that mana from a Treasure was spent to cast (Rain of
  Riches). Reads `CastSpellRecord.paidWithTreasureMana` on the per-player spell history.
- `PermanentTypeEnteredBattlefieldThisTurn(cardType, player = Player.You)` — true if a
  permanent of `cardType` entered the battlefield under `player`'s control at any point
  this turn. Pure ETB tracker: the permanent need not still be on the battlefield, still
  be of that type, or still be under the same controller — only the entry event matters
  (so Mechan Shieldmate's "as long as an artifact entered ... this turn" stays satisfied
  even if the artifact is destroyed before combat). Captured types are read from the
  *projected* state at the moment of entry, so a permanent that's an artifact via a
  continuous effect at ETB (Mycosynth Lattice, etc.) also counts. Backed by the per-player
  `PermanentTypesEnteredBattlefieldThisTurnComponent`, cleared by `CleanupPhaseManager` at
  end of turn. Every battlefield entry must go through `BattlefieldEntry.place` for this
  tracker to stay in sync. Shortcut: `Conditions.ArtifactEnteredBattlefieldThisTurn`.

### Composition

- `All(c1, c2, ...)` — AND.
- `Any(c1, c2, ...)` — OR.
- `Not(c)` — negate.
- `Compare(v1, op, v2)` — numeric comparison between `DynamicAmount`s.
- `Exists(player, zone, filter)` — at least one matching object exists.
- `FixedIfCondition(...)` — bake a condition into a static-ability gate.

### Static-ability vs resolution-time evaluation

Every `Condition` works in both contexts: at spell/trigger resolution (full
`EffectContext` — targets, kicker, triggering entity, etc.) and during state projection
inside a `ConditionalStaticAbility` (only the source entity and projected values are
known). The engine dispatches via a `ConditionEvaluationContext.Resolution` /
`Projection` sealed type — there is **no** separate `SourceProjectionCondition` arm.

Conditions that need resolution-only facts (e.g. `TargetMatchesFilter`, `TriggeringEntity*`,
`WasKicked`, `ManaSpentToCastIncludes`, `CollectionContainsMatch`) silently evaluate to
`false` under projection — a static-ability gate is never "in the middle of casting a spell".

Other gates available in both contexts:

- `SourceChosenModeIs("id")` — gate on the chosen mode (Sieges / `EntersWithChoice`).
  Currently resolution-only; can be extended to projection if needed.

---

## 13. Dynamic amounts (`DynamicAmount.*`)

Numbers computed at resolution time.

### Math

- `Fixed(n)` — literal constant.
- `XValue` — the X chosen for the spell/ability.
- `Add(a, b)` — `a + b`.
- `Subtract(a, b)` — `a − b`.
- `Multiply(a, b)` — `a × b`.
- `Divide(a, b, roundUp?)` — division with rounding rule.
- `Min(a, b)` — minimum.
- `Max(a, b)` — maximum.
- `Absolute(a)` — `|a|`.

### Battlefield aggregation

- `AggregateBattlefield(player, filter)` — count matching permanents.
- `AggregateZone(player, zone, filter?, aggregation?)` — count cards in a zone.
- `CountPermanentsOfType(player, subtype)` — count by creature type.
- `CountCreaturesYouControl` — shorthand for "your creatures".

### Player & game

- `LifeTotal(player)` — current life total.
- `HandSize(player)` — cards in hand.
- `TurnCount(player)` — turn number for that player.
- `TurnTracking(player, TurnTracker)` — value of a per-turn counter (see below).

### Counters

- `CountersOnSource(type)` — counters of `type` on the source permanent.
- `LastKnownCountersOnSource(type)` — counters when source last existed (for dies-triggers).
- `CountersOnTarget(target, type)` — counters on a target permanent.
- `CountersOnContext(path, type)` — counters stored in an `EffectContext` path.

### Card properties

- `TargetPower(target)` — target's current power.
- `TargetToughness(target)` — target's current toughness.
- `TargetManaValue(target)` — target's mana value.
- `DynamicAmounts.targetManaSpent(index)` — sum of all `manaSpent{Color}` buckets on
  the targeted spell's `SpellOnStackComponent` (i.e. what was actually paid, after
  cost reductions/increases). Pair with `targetManaValue()` for "if the amount of
  mana spent to cast that spell was less than its mana value" gates (Unravel).
  Desugars to `EntityProperty(EntityReference.Target(index), EntityNumericProperty.ManaSpent)`.
  Returns 0 if the target isn't a spell on the stack.
- `CardNumericProperty(card, property)` — generic numeric property accessor.

### Triggering-entity shortcuts (`DynamicAmounts.*` facades)

For triggered abilities whose effect reads a property of the entity that caused the trigger
(rather than the source of the ability):

- `DynamicAmounts.triggeringPower()` — power of the triggering entity (e.g. Warstorm Surge:
  "it deals damage equal to its power").
- `DynamicAmounts.triggeringToughness()` — toughness of the triggering entity.
- `DynamicAmounts.triggeringManaValue()` — mana value of the triggering entity.

All three desugar to `EntityProperty(EntityReference.Triggering, …)`.

### Attached-creature shortcut (`DynamicAmounts.*` facade)

For Aura/Equipment abilities that read a property of the creature the source is attached to (rather
than the source permanent itself — for an Aura, `EntityReference.Source` is the Aura, not the creature):

- `DynamicAmounts.enchantedCreaturePower()` — power of the attached creature (e.g. Pain for All:
  "enchanted creature deals damage equal to its power"). Desugars to
  `EntityProperty(EntityReference.EnchantedCreature, EntityNumericProperty.Power)`. The
  `EnchantedCreature` reference resolves through the source's `AttachedToComponent` (state-aware), so it
  needs an effect context with a `sourceId`; it returns 0 in predicate/filter-only contexts that don't
  thread state. When read in a **triggered ability** and the attached creature has already left the
  battlefield by resolution (e.g. removed in response to the aura's ETB trigger), it falls back to the
  creature's last-known power — captured when the trigger fired — per CR 608.2g, rather than 0.

### Context-plumbed

- `ContextProperty(key)` — value plumbed via `EffectContext`. Keys include:
  - `TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT` — damage in the current trigger payload (Tephraderm).
  - `TRIGGER_LIFE_GAINED` / `TRIGGER_LIFE_LOST` — life delta from a `LifeChangedEvent`.
  - `TRIGGER_COUNTERS_PLACED_AMOUNT` — counters placed in the triggering event (Simic Ascendancy).
  - `LAST_KNOWN_PLUS_ONE_COUNTER_COUNT` / `LAST_KNOWN_TOTAL_COUNTER_COUNT` — counters on the
    source as it last existed on the battlefield (Hooded Hydra / Shadow Urchin).
  - `ADDITIONAL_COST_EXILED_COUNT` / `ADDITIONAL_COST_BLIGHT_AMOUNT` — cost-step accumulators.
  - `TARGET_COUNT` — still-legal targets in the current effect context.
  - `LINKED_EXILE_CARD_COUNT` / `LINKED_EXILE_DISTINCT_CARD_TYPE_COUNT` — cards / distinct
    types in the source's linked exile pile (Veteran Survivor / Keen-Eyed Curator).
  - `MODES_CHOSEN_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL` — number of mode picks recorded on the cast that fired
    the trigger (Riku of Many Paths). Counts selections, not distinct modes, so Spree with
    the same mode twice reads as `2`.
- `AdditionalCostBlightAmount` — X paid via the Blight additional cost.
- `ChosenNumber` — number a player chose via a Choose action.
- `VariableReference(name)` — named variable stored earlier by `StoreResult`/`StoreCount`.
- `ColorsAmongPermanents(player)` — count of distinct colors among player's permanents.

### `ManaColorSet`<a id="manacolorset"></a>

Color analogue of `DynamicAmount` — pure data resolved at the moment a mana effect fires.
Used by `AddManaOfChoice(colorSet, amount)`; the engine's `ManaColorSetResolver` materializes
a `Set<Color>` from the source/controller/projected state, the player picks one (or the
solver picks if there's only one), and that color is added to the pool.

- `ManaColorSet.AnyColor` — all five colors. The "any-color" default.
- `ManaColorSet.Specific(colors)` — hand-authored fixed set (e.g., `{R, G}` for a Gruul producer).
- `ManaColorSet.CommanderIdentity` — union of color identities of every commander the controller has registered. Empty (no mana produced) in non-Commander formats.
- `ManaColorSet.AmongPermanents(filter)` — colors of permanents matching `filter`, read via projected state so type/color-changing effects are honored. Mox Amber shape.
- `ManaColorSet.LandsCouldProduce(scope)` — colors any land in `scope` could produce; tapped state and activation costs are ignored (CR 106.7). `scope` is `LandControllerScope.{YOU, OPPONENTS, ANY}`. Fellwar Stone / Exotic Orchard / Reflecting Pool shape.
- `ManaColorSet.SourceChosenColor` — the single color stored on the source's `ChosenColorComponent` (set via `EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.COLOR)`). Uncharted Haven / Ashling Rekindled shape.

### `ManaRestriction`

Spending restrictions attached to a unit of mana when it is added to the pool. Used by
`AddMana`, `AddColorlessMana`, and `AddManaOfChoice` (via the `restriction` parameter).
When the engine pays a spell's cost, restricted mana is consumed preferentially when its
restriction matches the spell context.

- `ManaRestriction.AnySpend` — no restriction; satisfies any spend. Used internally when
  `AddManaOfChoice(riders = ...)` is provided without an explicit restriction, so the rider
  set survives in the pool without limiting where the mana can be spent (Path of Ancestry).
- `ManaRestriction.InstantOrSorceryOnly` — only instants and sorceries.
- `ManaRestriction.KickedSpellsOnly` — only kicked spells.
- `ManaRestriction.CreatureSpellsOnly` / `CreatureMV4OrXCost` / `SpellsMV4OrGreater` —
  creature- or mana-value-gated.
- `ManaRestriction.SubtypeSpellsOrAbilitiesOnly(subtype, creatureOnly?)` — Cavern of Souls /
  Unclaimed Territory: only spells of a baked subtype, optionally creature-only.
- `ManaRestriction.CastFromExileOnly` — only spells cast from exile.
- `ManaRestriction.CardTypeSpellsOrAbilitiesOnly(cardType, allowSpells?, allowAbilities?)` —
  Steelswarm Operator shape.

### `ManaSpellRider`

Side-effects attached to mana that fire when the mana is spent on a spell. Orthogonal to
`ManaRestriction`: the restriction controls *where* the mana may be spent; the rider
controls *what happens to the spell* when it is spent. The cast pipeline either mutates the
spell directly (e.g. stamps a component) or queues a triggered ability onto the stack above
the spell when the rider needs the stack (typically because it requires a player decision).

- `ManaSpellRider.MakesSpellUncounterable` — Cavern of Souls: stamps `CantBeCounteredComponent`
  on the spell at cast time.
- `ManaSpellRider.ScryOnSharedTypeWithCommander(amount)` — Path of Ancestry: if the spell is
  a creature spell that shares a creature type with any of the controller's commanders,
  queues a `scry amount` triggered ability above the spell.

### `TurnTracker` keys (used with `TurnTracking`)

- `CREATURES_DIED` — creatures that died this turn.
- `NONTOKEN_CREATURES_DIED` — nontoken creatures that died this turn.
- `OPPONENT_CREATURES_EXILED` — opponent creatures you exiled.
- `OPPONENTS_WHO_LOST_LIFE` — count of opponents who lost life.
- `DAMAGE_RECEIVED` — damage received by player.
- `LIFE_GAINED` — life gained this turn (Bre of Clan Stoutarm).
- `LIFE_LOST` — life lost this turn.
- `PLAYER_ATTACKED` — whether/how many times you attacked.
- `DEALT_COMBAT_DAMAGE` — combat damage dealt.
- `COUNTERS_PUT_ON_CREATURE` — counters placed.
- `LANDS_PLAYED` — lands played this turn.
- `FOOD_SACRIFICED` — Food tokens sacrificed.
- `CARDS_LEFT_GRAVEYARD` — cards leaving your graveyard.

---

## 14. Modal & choice

### Modal spells

```kotlin
spell {
    modal(chooseCount = 1) {
        mode("Destroy a creature") {
            val c = target("creature", Targets.Creature)
            effect = Effects.Destroy(c)
        }
        mode("Draw a card") {
            effect = Effects.DrawCards(1)
        }
    }
}
```

- `modal(chooseCount = N) { ... }` — N modes picked at cast time (or resolution for Commands).
- `mode(description) { ... }` — one option with its own targets/effect.
- `.requiresTarget(filter)` — mode needs a target matching filter.
- `.optional()` — mode can be skipped.
- `Mode.noTarget(...)` — explicit target-less mode (outer targets are preserved).

`ModalEffect.chooseOne { mode(...) }` and `ModalEffect.chooseN(n) { ... }` for explicit modal effects.

**Dynamic "choose up to X"** — `ModalEffect.chooseUpToDynamic(dynamicMax, *modes, allowRepeat = false)`
caps the pick count by a `DynamicAmount` evaluated at resolution time. `minChooseCount` is
forced to `0` (the player may always decline); `chooseCount` becomes `min(eval, modes.size)`.
If the evaluated cap is `0` the effect resolves as a no-op. Used by Riku of Many Paths,
where the cap is `ContextProperty(MODES_CHOSEN_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL)`. Equivalent raw shape:
`ModalEffect(modes, chooseCount = modes.size, minChooseCount = 0, dynamicChooseCount = …)`.

### Permanent enters-with-choice (Sieges)

```kotlin
EntersWithChoice(
    ChoiceType.MODE,
    modeOptions = listOf(
        ModeOption(id = "khans", label = "Khans", description = "...", iconKey = "khans"),
        ModeOption(id = "dragons", label = "Dragons", description = "...", iconKey = "dragons"),
    ),
)
```

- Writes `ChosenModeComponent(modeId)` on the permanent.
- Downstream triggers/conditions gate via `SourceChosenModeIs("khans")`.
- Icons live in `web-client/src/assets/icons/options/`.

### Other choice effects

- `ChooseActionEffect(choices)` — pick one effect from a list.
- `ChooseColorThenEffect(whenChosen)` — pick a color, then apply a function of the color.
- `ChooseColorAndGrantProtectionTo{Target,Group}Effect` — color → protection from that color.
- `GrantHexproofFromChosenColorEffect(target)` — same shape, hexproof.
- `ChooseCreatureTypeEffect(...)` — pause for creature-type selection.
- `SelectTargetEffect(...)` — pick from a valid target set.
- `SeparatePermanentsIntoPilesEffect(filter, piles)` — divvy permanents into piles (Fact-or-Fiction shape).

---

## 15. Replacement effects

```kotlin
replacementEffect {
    condition = Conditions.YouControl(Filters.Swamp)
    effect = ReplacementEffect.PreventDamage(1)
}
```

- `ReplacementEffect.PreventDamage(amount?, direction?, scope?, source?, recipient?)` — prevent damage of a given shape.
- `ReplacementEffect.EntersBattlefieldTappedUnless(condition)` — ETB tapped unless condition met.
- `ReplacementEffect.IfYouDoBranchEffect(...)` — branch on "if you do" replacement.
- `OnEnterRunEffect(effect)` — generic "as ~ enters the battlefield, run [effect]". The wrapped effect
  executes via the normal effect-executor pipeline at entry time (so `EffectTarget.Self` resolves to
  the entering permanent) and may pause for player input. Compose with atomic pausable effects like
  `Effects.MayRevealCardFromHand` to build SOI shadow lands or other "as ~ enters" choices.
  **Scope today:** only wired into the land-play path (`PlayLandHandler`). When the first non-land
  permanent needs this, also wire it into `StackResolver.enterPermanentOnBattlefield`.
- `EntersWithDevour(multiplier, sacrificeFilter, counterType, variant)` — Devour (CR 702.82) and its
  printed variants. As the permanent resolves from the stack, the controller is prompted to pick any
  number of their own permanents matching `sacrificeFilter`. Those permanents are sacrificed and the
  entering permanent gains `multiplier × count` counters of `counterType` (default `+1/+1`). Pair
  with `KeywordAbility.Devour(multiplier, sacrificeFilter, variant)` so the rules text renders. The
  `variant` parameter is a textual tag only — `""` for plain Devour, `"land"` for the EOE
  "Devour land N" wording. **Scope today:** only the stack-spell entry path is wired; reanimation and
  token entries skip Devour (which is fine for printed cards — Devour creatures all cost real mana to
  cast).
- Custom — implement the `ReplacementEffect` interface directly.

Amount-modifying replacements expose **both** `multiplier` (×) and `modifier` (±) on the same type — do not split into
`DoubleX` + `ModifyXAmount`.

---

## 16. Counters

String-keyed counter types — resolve via the central `resolveCounterType` helper rather than per-executor character
substitution.

- `+1/+1`, `-1/-1` — power/toughness counters.
- `loyalty` — planeswalker loyalty.
- `charge`, `time`, `level`, `quest`, `shield`, `fade`, `vanishing`, `experience`, `age`, `velocity`, `awakening`,
  `blood`, `cage`, `doom`, `storage`, `divinity`, `charm`, `music`, `crumble`, `corpse`, `germ`, `ink`, `growth`,
  `hour`, `energy`, `scry`, `aura`, `chapter`, `citation`, `rune`, `scar`, `crux`, `omen`, `secret` — assorted printed
  counter kinds.

Counter effects live in §4 (`AddCounters`, `RemoveCounters`, `Proliferate`, `MoveAllLastKnownCounters`, etc.).

---

## 17. Zones & movement

**Zones** — `BATTLEFIELD`, `HAND`, `LIBRARY`, `GRAVEYARD`, `EXILE`, `STACK`.

**Primitives**

- `MoveToZoneEffect(target, zone, faceDown?, byDestruction?, linked?)` — single-target move.
- `MoveCollectionEffect(collectionName, zone, faceDown?, linkToSource?, asOwner?, likelyPosition?)` — pipeline move of a
  stored collection.
- `GatherCardsEffect(source, filter, into)` — pipeline gather from a zone into a named collection. `CardSource`
  variants include zones (`FromZone`, `FromMultipleZones`), battlefield queries (`BattlefieldMatching`,
  `ControlledPermanents`), linked exile (`FromLinkedExile`), tapped-as-cost (`TappedAsCost`), and the resolved
  spell/ability targets (`ChosenTargets`).
- `CaptureControllersEffect(from, storeAs)` — snapshot each entity's current controller into a parallel
  `List<EntityId>` under `storedCollections[storeAs]`. Required when a later step needs "who controlled
  this card before it left the battlefield" — `ControllerComponent` is stripped on move-out.
- `ForEachCapturedControllerEffect(collection, originalCollection, controllerSnapshot, countVariable?, effects)` —
  cross-references a post-move `collection` against an `originalCollection` + parallel `controllerSnapshot` to
  build per-controller tallies, then runs `effects` once per controller (turn order from the active player). Each
  iteration sets `context.controllerId` to the controller (so `Player.You` / `EffectTarget.Controller` resolve to
  them) and writes the tally into `storedNumbers[countVariable]` (default `"iterationCount"`) for
  `DynamicAmount.VariableReference` to read. Outer `storedCollections` are preserved (unlike
  `ForEachPlayerEffect`). Used by Builder's Bane via the
  `GatherCards(ChosenTargets) → CaptureControllers → MoveCollection(Destroy, storeMovedAs) → ForEachCapturedController`
  shape.
- `SelectFromCollectionEffect(from, into, selectCount?, allowZero?, alwaysPrompt?)` — let a player pick from a
  collection.

**Linked exile**

- `Effects.ExileGroupAndLink(filter, storeAs?)` — exile matching permanents linked to source.
- `Effects.ReturnLinkedExile` — return all to controller.
- `ReturnLinkedExileUnderOwnersControl` — return to owners.
- `ReturnLinkedExileToHand` — return to hand.
- `ReturnOneFromLinkedExile` — return one chosen card.
- `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()` — play permission targeting linked-exile pile.
- `CardSource.FromExile(name)` — play permission for a named exile zone.

**Face-down**

- `PutOntoBattlefieldFaceDown(count, target?)` — enter face-down (morph shape).
- `Triggers.TurnedFaceUp` — fires when source flips face-up.
- UI label: `"Turn Face-Up"` (used by E2E `selectAction("Turn Face-Up")`).

---

## 18. Components (set indirectly by effects)

### Permanent

- `ChosenModeComponent` — chosen entry mode (Sieges, modal permanents).
- `TypeLineOverrideComponent` — temporary type-line edits.
- `CountersComponent` — all counters on the permanent.
- `EnchantedCreatureComponent` — reference to attached creature (Auras).
- `EquippedCreatureComponent` — reference to equipped creature.
- `LinkedExileComponent` — linked exile pile attached to source.
- `ExileOnLeaveComponent` — replace next zone change with exile.
- `MayPlayFromExileComponent` — owner may play this from exile.
- `TappedStateComponent` — tap state.
- `FaceDownComponent` — face-down state.
- `ControllerComponent` — current controller.
- `ProtectionComponent` — protection from colors/types.
- `CantAttackComponent` / `CantBlockComponent` — combat restrictions.

### Player

- `PlayerCitysBlessingComponent` — you have City's Blessing.
- `SpellsCantBeCounteredComponent` — your matching spells can't be countered.
- `LifeGainedAmountThisTurnComponent` — accumulator for life gained.
- `LifeLostThisTurnComponent` — marker that you've lost life this turn.
- `PlayerAttackedThisTurnComponent` — marker that you've attacked this turn.
- `PlayerAttackersThisTurnComponent` — list of attackers declared this turn.
- `LandDropsComponent` — lands played this turn.
- `FoodSacrificeThisTurnComponent` — marker that you sacrificed a Food this turn.
- `SpellsCastThisTurnByPlayer` — count of spells you cast this turn.

Card authors rarely reference these directly; they are created/updated by the matching effect or trigger.

---

## 19. Named-mechanic composites

- **Cycling / Typecycling / Basic landcycling** — `KeywordAbility.Cycling(cost)`, `Typecycling(type, cost)`,
  `BasicLandcycling(cost)`; unified via `TypecyclingVariant(cost, searchFilter, description)` in `TypecycleCardHandler`.
- **Plot (CR 718)** — `KeywordAbility.plot(cost)`. Engine wires a sorcery-speed `PlotEnumerator` + `PlotCardHandler`
  that pays the plot cost, exiles the card face-up from hand, stamps `PlottedComponent(controllerId, turnPlotted)` +
  `PlayWithoutPayingCostComponent`, and adds a permanent `MayPlayPermission` gated by `SourcePlottedOnPriorTurn`.
  The cast-from-exile path is the standard `MayPlayPermission` flow in `CastFromZoneEnumerator` — `permanent = true`
  keeps the grant alive across end-of-turn cleanup. Emits `CardPlottedEvent` / `ClientEvent.CardPlotted`.
- **Adventure (CR 715)** — `layout = ADVENTURE` + `cardFaces[0]` Adventure spell; DSL:
  `card { adventure("Name") { spell { … } } }`.
- **Hideaway N** — `KeywordAbility.hideaway(n)` (display, "Hideaway N") + `MoveCollectionEffect(faceDown = true,
  linkToSource = true)` + `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()`; no special engine plumbing needed.
- **Ascend / City's Blessing** — `Keyword.ASCEND` + `Effects.GainCitysBlessing()` + `Conditions.YouHaveCitysBlessing` /
  `SourceProjectionCondition.ControllerHasCitysBlessing` + `PlayerCitysBlessingComponent`.
- **Siege (named-mode entry)** — `EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.MODE, modeOptions = ...)` + `SourceChosenModeIs("id")`.
- **Morph** — `morph = "{2}{U}"` (top-level) + `morphFaceUpEffect` for "as it turns face up".
- **Warp** — `warp = "{1}{R}"`; alt-cost that exiles end of turn.
- **Evoke** — `evoke = "{U}"`; pay alt cost, sacrifice on ETB.
- **Earthbend** — `Effects.Earthbend` composes AnimateLand + GrantKeyword + AddCounters + granted self-triggers (no fake
  keyword).
- **Forage** — `EffectPatterns.forage`; cast-from-graveyard permissions need a branch in `CastSpellHandler.validate`.
- **Blight X** — `AdditionalCost.BlightVariable` + `DynamicAmount.AdditionalCostBlightAmount` +
  `Conditions.BlightWasPaid(n)`.
- **Divvy (Fact-or-Fiction)** — `EffectPatterns.factOrFiction(...)`; `SplitPilesDecision` stays dormant until N > 2.
- **Astral Slide / delayed return** — `ExileUntilEndStepEffect` + `DelayedTriggeredAbility`.
- **Lord effects** — multiple `staticAbility { }` blocks + `ModifyStatsForCreatureGroup` /
  `AffectsFilter.OtherCreaturesWithSubtype`.
- **Player-scoped uncounterable grant** — `Effects.GrantSpellsCantBeCountered(target, filter, duration)` +
  `SpellsCantBeCounteredComponent`.
- **Static emblems** — `Effects.CreatePermanentEmblem(...)` for planeswalker emblems with static abilities.

---

## 20. Miscellaneous author-facing knobs

- `triggeredAbility { controlledByTriggeringEntityController = true }` — the triggered ability is controlled by the
  triggering entity's controller (not source's). Useful for ETB-on-creature triggers and Death Match-style shapes.
- `metadata.oracleTextOverride` — bypass auto-generated oracle text when needed.
- `metadata.inBooster = false` — Special Guests, starter exclusives, bonus sheets.
- `colorIdentity` override is authoritative — never run `:mtg-sets:syncColorIdentityFromDump`.
- Layer dependencies (CR 613.8) — same-layer effects sort by dependency (trial application) before falling back to
  timestamp.
- Server is authoritative; never compute legal actions in the client. Every state change emits a `GameEvent` so triggers
  and animations can react.
