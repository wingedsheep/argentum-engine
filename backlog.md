# Backlog

## Bugs 

- [ ] Wicked pact should allow me to target two creatures in the UI, but only allows me to target one
- [ ] King's Assassin can choose a target, but the target is not destroyed
- [ ] Mulligan and deck search style is not correct (not portal)

## Features

- [x] Add persistence. If the game server restarts, keep games that are in progress. Maybe Redis or PostgreSQL?
